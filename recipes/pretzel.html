    <p>Delicious Soft Pretzels</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water (lukewarm-- no need to take temperature)</li>
        <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) instant or active dry yeast (<em>1 standard packet</em>)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (8g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3.75 - 4.25 cups (470- 530g) all-purpose flour + more for the counter surface (spoon & leveled)</li>
        <li>coarse salt for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425째F (218째C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir with a spoon until fairly mixed, about 1 minute. Some clusters of yeast will remain. Add salt and sugar; stir until fairly combined. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon (or dough hook attached to stand mixer) until dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it is still sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more. Poke the dough with your finger - if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough for about 3 minutes and shape into a ball. With a sharp knife, cut ball of dough into 1/3 cup sections. This measurement does not have to be exact - use as much or little dough for each pretzel as you wish - the size of the pretzel is completely up to you.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a rope with an even diameter. My ropes were twenty inches long. Take the right side and cross over to the left. Cross right to left again and flip up. That's a pretzel! Or, for a more traditional pretzel shape... take the ends and draw them together so the dough forms a circle. Twist the ends, then bring them towards yourself and press them down into a pretzel shape.</li>
        <li>Bring baking soda and water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1-2 pretzels into boiling water for 20-30 seconds. Any more than that and your pretzels will have a metallic taste. Using a slotted spatula, lift the pretzel out of the water and allow as much of the excess water to drip off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with coarse sea salt. Repeat with remaining pretzels.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes at 425째F (218째C). Turn the oven to broil and bake for 5 more minutes to brown the tops. Watch closely to avoid burning. I do the 5 minute broil no matter what kind of pretzel I'm making
